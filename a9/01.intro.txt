#  paste commands in the files here in this folder (in order of numbered file name) 
#   into the command prompt on the new server.

#    The server will need open-ssh-server installed. You can connect with username and password.
#    use putty or some ssh client that you can paste text into from the clipboard.
#     Other clients are mremote, windows ssh in command prompt. There are many others. 

#    Use filezilla - connection over ssh to put files on the server.
#      To edit files on the server right click on a file and select edit. 
#      Filezilla will put the file back after you save it.

#      If you need to edit files as root, copy it to writable folder and then   
#         copy it back after editing, or just use sed or nano to edit the files.
#      Another alternative to filezilla is cyberduck.
