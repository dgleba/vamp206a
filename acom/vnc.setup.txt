# Remote desktop

1.
in ubu 20.04 settings gui 
-sharing, screen, enable
password: xx


2.
-from bash command line:

gsettings reset org.gnome.Vino network-interface 
gsettings set org.gnome.Vino require-encryption false


3.
-use tigntvnc for windows client as we do for windows pc's with tightvncserver installed.


4.
enable autologin for albe user.
  gnome may not allow logging in from vnc. 
  It's an unaddressed shortcoming. I think XFCE does allow login from vnc.
